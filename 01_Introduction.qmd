# Introduction
Here are some things you can do:

## Code blocks

```{r}
sin(8)
```

## Citations
You an include citations in your Quarto document by putting a bibliography file (e.g., Bibtex format) in the directory where the document lives and indicating its location in the `bibliography:` tag in the YAML. Then you can put formatted citations into the text by tagging them with the `@` symbol. Trying this at @datalab-website. By default the bibliography goes at the end of the chapter, but you can control that wil YAML settings.

## Math
There is support for LaTeX style math^[There are multiple engines used behind the scenes to render the math into a readable format. [MathJax](https://mathjax.org) is the default and the one I know best but you can ]. There are 

$$
\bar{X} = \frac{1}{N} \Sigma_{i=1}^N X_i
$$

### Figures
```{r}
#| label: fig-stopping-distance
#| fig-cap: Stopping distance as a funtion of speed
library( ggplot2 )
data(cars)

ggplot(cars) +
  aes(x=speed, y=dist) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  xlab( "Speed (mph)") +
  ylab( "Stopping distance (ft)")
```
